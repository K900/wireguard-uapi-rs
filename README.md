# wireguard-uapi-rs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gluxon/wireguard-uapi-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gluxon/wireguard-uapi-rs)

At the moment this library just talks to the WireGuard dynamic kernel module. You probably also want rtnetlink, which will be supported at a later date.

Checkout the examples folder for some guidance on how to use this library.
